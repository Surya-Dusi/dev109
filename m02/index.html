        <h2>Chicken Marbella</h2>
        <caption>Chicken Marbella is a classic chicken recipe that is easy to make by marinating chicken pieces overnight with sweet prunes, olives, garlic, and red wine vinegar. Baste the chicken with the pan juices as it bakes for amazing flavor. It's a perfect party dish, and keeps and reheats well.</caption>

                            <li>Preheat oven to 375°F. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Spread butter on both sides of each slice of bread and place on the prepared pan. Bake, flipping once halfway through, until bread is lightly browned on both sides, about 8 minutes.</li>

Use the back of a spoon to make an indentation in the middle of the bread slices, pushing down firmly to reach the bottom slice. Add the pizza sauce to the indentation, and sprinkle half the Italian seasoning over the top. Cover with remaining ½ ounce mozzarella cheese and pepper jack, followed by jalapeño and pepperoni. Garnish with remaining Italian seasoning, crushed red pepper and black pepper.</li>
                            <li>Bake until the cheese is melted and golden-brown, about 5 minutes. Slice in half and serve.</li>
